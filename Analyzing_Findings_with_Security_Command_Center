# Continuous Export Pipeline from Security Command Center to Pub/Sub

This project demonstrates i set up a continuous export pipeline from Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC) to Pub/Sub. This export allows for the automatic forwarding of security findings to external systems like Splunk or QRadar for further analysis and response.

## Overview
In this project, i configured a continuous export of security findings from Google Cloud Security Command Center to a Pub/Sub topic. The export only includes newly created, active, and unmuted findings. This setup can be used to integrate with external security monitoring systems like Splunk.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Access to a Google Cloud project with Security Command Center and Pub/Sub enabled.
- Basic understanding of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, particularly Security Command Center and Pub/Sub.

### Creating the Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription

1. Open the **Google Cloud Console**.
2. Navigate to **Pub/Sub > Topics** from the navigation menu.
3. Click **Create Topic** and enter `export-findings-pubsub-topic` as the Topic ID.
4. Navigate to **Subscriptions** in the left-hand menu.
5. Click on the automatically created subscription associated with the topic (e.g., `export-findings-pubsub-topic-sub`).
6. This subscription will be used to receive security findings from Security Command Center.

### Configuring Continuous Export in Security Command Center

1. Open the navigation menu and select **Security > Security Command Center > Overview > Settings**.
2. Go to the **Continuous Exports** tab.
3. Click **Create Pub/Sub Export**.
4. Enter `export-findings-pubsub` for the export name.
5. For the description, enter `Continuous exports of Findings to Pub/Sub and BigQuery`.
6. Select your project's ID.
7. Choose the `export-findings-pubsub-topic` from the dropdown list.
8. Set the findings query to:
    ```sql
    state="ACTIVE"
    AND NOT mute="MUTED"
    ```
9. Click **Save**.

### Testing the Setup

1. Open a **Cloud Shell** session.
2. Create a new virtual machine (VM) instance by running the following command:
    ```bash
    gcloud compute instances create instance-1 --zone=YOUR-LAB-ZONE --machine-type=e2-micro --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
    ```
3. The creation of the VM triggers new findings in the SCC:
   - Public IP address
   - Default service account used
   - Compute secure boot disabled
4. Navigate to **Pub/Sub > Subscriptions** in the Cloud Console.
5. Select `export-findings-pubsub-topic-sub`.
6. Click the **Messages** tab.
7. Enable **ack messages** and click **Pull** to retrieve messages.
8. You should see messages related to the newly generated security findings.

### Results and Output

After creating the VM, three security findings should be exported to the Pub/Sub topic and visible in the subscription:
- **Public IP Address**
- **Default Service Account Used**
- **Compute Secure Boot Disabled**

These findings can then be forwarded to an external security monitoring system like Splunk for further analysis.

### Conclusion

This task demonstrates how i set up continuous export of security findings from Google Cloud Security Command Center to Pub/Sub. This pipeline ensures that critical security findings are immediately available for external monitoring and response.
